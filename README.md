# Fulton County Vendor Payments

This is an [analysis](https://drevanzyl.github.io/Fulton-County-Vendor-Payments/index.html) project of payments made to Fulton County vendors for products and services provided to the County. The [payment records](https://data.fultoncountyga.gov/Tax-Finance/Vendor-Payments/mxhc-krcg) span from January 1, 2014, to the present. Included with each payment record are the disbursement date, the department making the payment, the type of service or product, the fund from which the payment is drawn, the payment amount, and the name of the vendor to which the payment was made. This dataset is updated weekly.


There are 5 major components or outputs in this analysis project: 

1. An [R Project hosted on Gitub](https://github.com/drevanzyl/Fulton-County-Vendor-Payments). 
2. Within the project, there is a [Fulton-County-Vendor-Payments.Rmd](https://github.com/drevanzyl/Fulton-County-Vendor-Payments/blob/main/Fulton-County-Vendor-Payments.Rmd) file which downloads, processes, and loads the data to Google Sheets.  
3. [Fulton-County-Vendor-Payments.Rmd](https://github.com/drevanzyl/Fulton-County-Vendor-Payments/blob/main/Fulton-County-Vendor-Payments.Rmd) file also produces a [webpage](https://drevanzyl.github.io/Fulton-County-Vendor-Payments/index.html) that contains narrative, analysis, and the R syntax used for each step. 
4. The processed data can be found on [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yVUKyYIfw6-2f6HfHImNtVORrBTnuIuCpZRDrNCYaI8/edit#gid=1167279414).
5. The processed data stored in Google Sheets is used in [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/s/) to generate [interactive visualizations](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/andr.van.zyl/viz/Atlanta_16292337333820/About).
